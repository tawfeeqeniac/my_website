        <h3>OBJECTIVE</h3>

        <p>
          I'm a BCA graduate with a passion for data science, machine learning,
          and the endless possibilities hidden within data. I’m always eager to
          expand my skill set and explore new frontiers. Beyond tech, I’m deeply
          fascinated by biotechnology and genetics — fields where data and
          science intersect to shape the future of medicine and human health. My
          long-term ambition is to become a Machine Learning Engineer in the
          biotech domain, contributing to innovations that improve lives.
          Alongside this, I have a deep interest in philosophy, which helps me
          think critically, question deeply, and stay grounded in the bigger
          picture. Here, you’ll find my projects, reflections on the evolution
          of technology, and book-based explorations that fuel my thinking.
          Thanks for stopping by — I hope you find something here that inspires
          you too.
