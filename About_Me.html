        <h2>I love asking questions, learning across disciplines, and exploring how science and technology can make sense of life and our world.</h2>
        <p>I am endlessly curious about the world around me, especially where philosophy, life sciences, biology, and technology meet. My love for STEM comes from a desire to understand how different fields connect and how their intersections can shape new ideas, discoveries, and solutions. This website is a reflection of that curiosity and my journey of learning across disciplines. I am deeply fascinated by the philosophical dimensions of STEM — reflecting on questions like what the “cell” of computer science might be, or how transistors, bits, and algorithms form the foundations of our digital world. My curiosity spans across mathematics, computer science, biology, and philosophy, and extends into politics and geopolitics, where I explore how scientific and technological concepts shape societies and global dynamics. I aspire to spend my life asking probing, interdisciplinary questions and seeking answers that connect science, philosophy, and human progress.</p>
